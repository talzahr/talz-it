# talz-it
Reddit scraper using Python and PRAW. Retrieve top posts from a list of subreddits.  

Currently works. Just going to add a couple of loops for now to select subs from list and to return to prompt instead of exiting automatically. 

If using this, modify auth.py to include application information generated from https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps/
after "create another app." The "client_id" is just below the "personal use script" text. 

Users of the script must follow all Reddit API and developer rules and license agreement.
